                    About Me!
                    </header>
                    <p id="biopara">     My name is Lolyn Tejeda. In accordance to my amateur ranking as a coder, I will rely heavily upon this paragraph to relay much of the information pertaining to who I am. I am 17 years old and am the youngest of 5 siblings: Cindy, Jenny, Helio, & Alejandra. I have three dogs (all of which I consider my babies): Shadow, Pepe, and Phoebe. There isn't much to my person other than the notion of my adaptability to learning new skills from which I hope to benefit in this AP Computer Science Principles class. My brother graduated from UC Irvine with a major in computer science which is, primarily, my reason for taking the course. My interests are largely centered around history, foreign language, and chemistry. At university, I strive to pursue simultaneous degrees in both Chemistry and Comparitive Literature with a focus on Global Historical Distinctions. I'm not going to lie, I am probably addicted to AP course as I am now taking 5 during MY SENIOR YEAR in which the vast majority of students choose to take courses in which they know they would excel in order to have smooth sailing into graduation; I don't shy away from the road less travelled by. I aspire to become either an Orthopedic or Pediatric Surgeon, so I still have roughly FOURTEEN years left of school, smh. Anyway, I like to read classical literature because I just haven't found that many modern novels that grab my attention as <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> and <i>The Scarlet Letter</i> do. I realize that this paragraph is going on for some time so I will wrap it up by saying that I hope my coding will improves throughout the duration of this year :)</p>
